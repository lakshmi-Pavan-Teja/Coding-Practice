## Agenda:
1. Doubly Linked List
2. Circular Linked List

1. The node of Doubly Linked List consists of three fields Data field, Previous address and Next address
2. Previous Node address stores previous one and Next Node address stores the next field
   
• If the Doubly Linked List is having only single Node then

• It means the previous and next node is pointing to the NULL value

• If the Doubly Linked List is having more than one Node then First Node Previous Field is points to NULL and Last Node Next field is points to NULL

## Today's Implementations:

1. Insert a Node - Start of Doubly Linked List
2. Insert a Node - End of Doubly Linked List
3. Insert a Node - Sorted Order 
4. Delete a Node - Start
5. Delete a Node - End
