## Data Structure:
It is a process of handling a huge amount of data or organizing the data into a particular process.

Example: Database, File System and etc

## Linear DS:
A Linear data structure have data elements arranged in sequential manner and each member element is connected to its previous and next element.

## Non Linear DS:
Data structures where data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures.

Here U can find Examples:
Linear DS | Non Linear DS
--------- | -------------
 Array  | Tree
Linked list | Graph
stack|
Queue|

## Array:
It is Static data structure it means the memory will be allocated at compile time

## Linked List:
It is Dynamic Data structure which the memory is allocated at runtime

Linked List consists of two things:

1. Data 

2. Address

It is very easy for performing the insert, update and delete operations and these can be done from any place

1. Single Linked List
2. Doubly Linked List
3. Circular Linked List


## Singly Linked List:

Insert : Start, End and Middle

Delete : Start, End and Middle


### Insert a node - Start of Singly Linked List
### Insert a node - Sorting order 

for the above two there is slight difference in InsertNode Only 

## Go and check out from the above
